# Vercel Deployment Fix

## The Issue
Vercel was looking for an output directory named "client" but our build creates "dist/public".

## Current Solution
The `vercel.json` is now configured for **static frontend deployment only**. This means:

✅ **Works**: Frontend application loads and displays  
❌ **Doesn't Work**: API routes (/api/*, database connections, authentication)

## For Full-Stack Deployment

If you need the complete application with backend API:

1. **Use the full-stack configuration**:
```bash
mv vercel.json vercel-static.json
mv vercel-fullstack.json vercel.json
```

2. **Deploy with environment variables**:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

3. **Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard**:
   - DATABASE_URL
   - VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY  
   - VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
   - VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID
   - All other variables from .env.example

## Alternative Platforms for Full-Stack

For complete functionality, consider these alternatives:

**Railway** (Recommended for full-stack):
```bash
npm i -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway up
```

**Render**:
- Connect GitHub repo
- render.yaml will be auto-detected

**Replit Deploy**:
- Click Deploy button (already configured)

## Current Status

With the current vercel.json:
- ✅ Frontend deploys successfully
- ✅ React app loads and displays
- ❌ Authentication won't work (needs Firebase + backend)
- ❌ Database operations won't work
- ❌ All /api/* routes return 404

Choose full-stack configuration above if you need complete functionality.
