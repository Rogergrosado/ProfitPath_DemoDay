📦 Inventory-Driven Features Across the App
Feature	How Inventory Powers It
KPIs	Revenue, profit, total inventory value
Performance	Calculates based on price, cost, units sold per SKU
Reports	Pulls inventory + sales to generate category or SKU-based insights
Reorder System	Triggers alerts when quantity drops below lowStockThreshold
Forecasting	Inventory level + sales velocity = stockout predictions

🧪 Example Use Case
Let’s say a user promotes a new SKU called "BTS-2024-001" from the watchlist:

It gets added to inventory with quantity: 200, cost: $15, price: $35

Over the next 30 days, 150 units are sold via SalesEntry

Inventory drops to 50 units → triggers reorder alert

Dashboard updates total stock value

Performance page shows revenue + profit breakdown

Goals page shows 75% progress toward “Sell 200 units in 30 days”

Reports include this product in “Top Performing SKUs” widget

✅ Summary:
The Inventories Sub-Page is the operational command center of ProfitPath. It turns watchlist items into live products and becomes the backbone of your performance metrics, reorder logic, goals, and reports.
