Thanks for the screenshots and details. You’ve already structured the frontend beautifully — filters are in place, logs are loading, and the KPI cards are styled — but right now:

The top KPI cards in the Performance page are still active, but should be removed or replaced.

Both Performance and Dashboard KPI values are stuck at $0, even though the logs clearly show valid revenue and profit (e.g., $489.86 revenue, $360.36 profit for 14 units sold).

Your filters and analytics log work, but the KPIs aren’t dynamically updating from the same data.

Let’s fix and sync all KPI logic. Below is a custom Replit prompt for this stage of your project:

🛠 Replit Prompt: Final Fixes for Dynamic KPIs on Performance & Dashboard Pages
✅ 1. PERFORMANCE PAGE: Remove Old Static KPIs & Activate Filtered KPI Block
Frontend Tasks:

❌ Remove or hide the top-level KPIs above the “Sales History” tab (where you see $0 for everything — these are outdated and unused).

✅ Instead, display only the filtered KPI block under the "Performance Filters" section. This is the correct section that should be dynamically linked to:

Filters (date range, category, SKU)

Sale history entries

Update Flow:

When user applies any filter → update KPI cards below the filters (green, blue, purple, orange cards).

Automatically calculate:

Total Revenue: SUM(unit_price × units)

Total Profit: SUM((unit_price - cost_price) × units)

Units Sold: SUM(units)

Avg Order Value: Total Revenue / Order Count (count of entries)

Fix the data source:

These KPIs should use the same data source as the log below them (probably from sales_history).

Reuse GET /api/performance/kpis with query:

ts
Copiar
Editar
/api/performance/kpis?start=2025-06-22&end=2025-07-22&category=All&sku=HEA-6844
If this endpoint doesn’t exist yet, implement it (see backend section below).

✅ 2. DASHBOARD PAGE: Aggregate KPIs for Career-Wide Stats
KPI Cards:

Monthly Revenue ✅

Units Sold ✅

Profit Margin ✅

Conversion Rate (optional or placeholder)

Backend Tasks:

Implement GET /api/dashboard/kpis
Query your entire sales_history and inventory data to calculate:

Overall Revenue → SUM(unit_price × qty_sold)

Overall Units Sold → SUM(qty_sold)

Overall Profit → SUM((unit_price - cost_price) × qty_sold)

Profit Margin → (Overall Profit / Overall Revenue) × 100

Conversion Rate → (If you track views or sessions)

Save these as computed values in the backend and return as:

json
Copiar
Editar
{
  "overallRevenue": 116700,
  "overallUnitsSold": 394,
  "overallProfit": 29640,
  "profitMargin": 25.39,
  "conversionRate": 4.2
}
✅ 3. Backend Updates
If missing, implement these two endpoints:

GET /api/performance/kpis
Query Params:

startDate

endDate

category

sku

Returns:

json
Copiar
Editar
{
  "totalRevenue": 489.86,
  "totalProfit": 360.36,
  "unitsSold": 14,
  "avgOrderValue": 34.99
}
Logic:

Query sales_history using filters.

Join with inventory to get cost_price (if not stored in sales_history).

Return the calculated metrics.

GET /api/dashboard/kpis
No filters, just aggregate everything.

json
Copiar
Editar
{
  "overallRevenue": 116700,
  "overallUnitsSold": 394,
  "overallProfit": 29640,
  "profitMargin": 25.39,
  "conversionRate": 4.2
}
✅ 4. Trophy System Support
Make sure that your Dashboard KPI values (especially overallRevenue, overallUnitsSold, overallProfitMargin) are accessible to the Goal system.

This may require syncing a state or context store with the API data.

Example usage:

“Sell over $100k in revenue” → unlock trophy if overallRevenue > 100000

🔄 5. Optional Enhancements
Use skeleton loaders or “Loading metrics…” states while fetching KPI data.

Add an error boundary for API failures.

Add a “Refresh Metrics” button on the Dashboard (already exists on Performance).
