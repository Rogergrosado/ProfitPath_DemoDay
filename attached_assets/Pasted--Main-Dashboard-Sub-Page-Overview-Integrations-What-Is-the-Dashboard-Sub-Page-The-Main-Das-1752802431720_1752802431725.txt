📊 Main Dashboard Sub-Page – Overview & Integrations
🧠 What Is the Dashboard Sub-Page?
The Main Dashboard is the central command center of the ProfitPath platform. It offers a real-time, visual snapshot of a seller’s Amazon FBA business across sales, inventory, performance, and goals. It is the first place users land to assess how their business is performing today—and where it’s headed.

Think of it as the data cockpit, summarizing live activity from all critical systems.

🧱 What It Shows
The dashboard is composed of the following sections, all powered by real data:

Component	Description
📌 KPI Cards	Shows key metrics: Revenue, Profit, Units Sold, Conversion Rate
📦 Inventory Snapshot	Total items, stock value, low stock alerts
📈 Sales by Category Chart	Pie or bar chart summarizing revenue by product category
🧠 Tracked Products Mini-View	Snapshot of recently added or high-priority watchlist items
🎯 Goal Progress Overview	Highlights progress against revenue, unit, or margin goals
📊 Scenario Simulator (WIP)	Simulates “what-if” scenarios like price increases or cost changes

🔌 How It Connects to Other Sub-Pages
Sub-Page	What It Pulls
📦 Inventory	Inventory quantity, low stock threshold, reorder timing
📈 Performance	Revenue, profit, units sold, and time-based trends
📝 Sales Entry	Manual sales entered are counted toward units sold & revenue
🧾 Reports	Widgets here are also available as report components
🎯 Goals	Tracks progress across user-defined goals
🔄 CSV Imports	Imported sales or inventory reflect immediately here

The dashboard does not manage data directly, but it reflects and responds to data being added or changed across the rest of the app.

🔍 What It Helps the User Do
Use Case	How the Dashboard Helps
Quickly spot business trends	Is revenue rising or dropping? Did we hit our monthly goal?
Track daily ops at a glance	What’s out of stock? What just sold?
Avoid stockouts or missed goals	Immediate visibility into low inventory or lagging goal progress
Launch into deeper investigation	Click-throughs to Inventory, Performance, Goals, etc.
Compare time periods	Use global date filters (7d, 30d, 90d, 1y) to switch time frames

🧠 Underlying APIs and Logic
Component	API / Logic Source
KPI Cards	`/api/performance/metrics?range={7d
Inventory Snapshot	/api/inventory/summary
Tracked Products	/api/products/watchlist
Sales by Category	/api/performance/categories?range=30d
Goals Section	/api/goals/status

Data is fetched using useEffect with date range params and displayed in charts/cards. Fallbacks are in place to prevent visual breaks if an API fails.

🛠️ Technical Architecture
Client Components: Tailwind + reusable Chart/Stat components

Global Filter Context: Date range state shared across widgets

API.ts: All API calls centralized in lib/api.ts

Modular Imports: Each section (e.g., DashboardKPISection.tsx) imports only what it needs

🌍 User Flow Example
A seller logs in Monday morning:

Sees Revenue +10%, Units Sold ↑12%

Low Stock Alert says Wireless Earbuds are below 10 units

Tracked Products show a new item they just added last week

Goal Tracker says they’re 75% of the way to their Q3 profit goal

Clicks into Inventory to reorder

Opens Performance Page to view what’s driving growth
