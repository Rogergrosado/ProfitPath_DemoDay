Overview:
The Products Sub-Page in ProfitPath (technically made up of Watchlist Products and Inventory Items) is the source of truth for all items you track, test, and sell on Amazon FBA. It is your pipeline—from ideation to inventory.

🧱 Structure of the Products Sub-Page
It’s logically split into two views:

Watchlist Products (Pre-Inventory)

Products you’re researching, tracking, or prepping for launch.

Lives at: GET /api/products/watchlist

Inventory Items (Active SKUs in Stock)

Products that are launched and stocked.

Lives at: GET /api/inventory

Users “promote” items from Watchlist → Inventory once they’re approved for sourcing.

🔗 Key Connections to Other Sub-Pages
Connected Sub-Page	Connection Description	Data Flow Direction
📊 Dashboard	Pulls live product data from inventory to show KPIs (stock value, low stock alerts, top products).	Inventory → Dashboard
📈 Performance	Relies on SalesEntry records linked to each InventoryItem (via inventoryId) to calculate: revenue, units sold, profit, etc.	Inventory & SalesEntry → Performance
🎯 Goals	Goals are often set per product (e.g., “Sell 100 units of SKU X in 30 days”), so they pull inventory data for context and progress.	Inventory → Goals
📋 Reports	Uses both InventoryItem and SalesEntry to compile downloadable reports. Widgets might show sales trends per SKU, profit by category, etc.	Inventory + SalesEntry → Reports
🚨 Reorder Alerts	Based on lowStockThreshold, leadTimeDays, and current quantity for each product.	Inventory → Alerts
📥 Manual Entry / CSV Import	Allows uploading or manually entering product performance (sales, units sold). Maps to SKUs in the inventory table.	CSV → Inventory + SalesEntry
🧮 Scenario Simulator (on Dashboard)	Simulates future revenue/profit based on inventory sales velocity and pricing—needs product price, cost, and lead time.	Inventory → Simulator

🗂️ Database-Level Relationships
