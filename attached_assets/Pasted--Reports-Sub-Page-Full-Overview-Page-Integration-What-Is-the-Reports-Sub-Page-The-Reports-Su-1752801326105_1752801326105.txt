 Reports Sub-Page – Full Overview & Page Integration
🧠 What Is the Reports Sub-Page?
The Reports Sub-Page is the custom business intelligence builder in ProfitPath. It gives users the ability to:

📊 Create dynamic reports from their inventory, sales, goals, and performance data

📁 Use pre-built templates (like Profit Margin by Category or Reorder Schedule)

🧩 Drag and drop components (charts, tables, metrics) into a report layout

🧾 Export reports to CSV or PDF

🕒 Review historical reports and optionally schedule new ones

It’s where data storytelling meets decision-making.

🧱 Core Features
Feature	Description
ReportBuilder.tsx	The main drag-and-drop interface for assembling custom reports
ReportComponentsPanel.tsx	Sidebar with widgets like “Top Products,” “Low Stock Items,” “Revenue Over Time,” etc.
PrebuiltTemplates.tsx	Ready-to-go reports: “Inventory Snapshot,” “Sales Performance,” “Goal Tracker”
RecentReports.tsx	History of reports created or exported
ExportDelivery.tsx	PDF/CSV export and scheduling logic

🔌 How It Connects to Other Sub-Pages
Sub-Page	Connection to Reports
📦 Inventory	Pulls live inventory status (stock, value, reorder thresholds)
📊 Dashboard	Reports can replicate dashboard KPIs in downloadable form
📈 Performance	Draws from sales data, margins, units sold, category performance
🎯 Goals	Track progress toward active goals in time-based reports
📝 Manual Sales Entry	Sales entered manually can be included in trend reports

📁 All of these sources are unified under the /api/reports/... system. Each widget pulls from a designated API hook, and report layouts can mix multiple types.

💼 Business Use Cases
Scenario	Example Report
📌 Quarterly Review	“Q2 Performance & Inventory Overview” (sales, profit, low stock)
📤 Sharing with stakeholders	“Top Products by Margin” PDF to email investors
📦 Supply planning	“Next Month Reorder Plan” (low stock + supplier + ETA)
📈 Goal review	“Monthly Goal Tracker” showing target vs actual
📁 Record keeping	“Daily Sales CSV” export for accountant or tax filing

🛠️ Technical Overview – What It Actually Does
Each report is a composition of:

📦 Components (KPI blocks, tables, charts)

📐 Layout (grid config stored as JSON)

🎯 Filters (date range, category, product, etc.)

💾 Metadata (title, description, timestamps)

💻 Export Options (CSV, PDF, scheduled email)
