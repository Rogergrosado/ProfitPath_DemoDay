What Is the Performance Sub-Page?
The Performance Sub-Page is the central analytics engine of ProfitPath. It provides users with insightful metrics, trend tracking, and profit analysis derived from real sales data—both manual entries and (eventually) Amazon MWS/API sources.

Where the Dashboard gives you a quick overview, the Performance page is where users go to analyze trends, track progress, and explore their business performance in depth.

📋 What Does It Display?

KPI Cards	Shows key stats: Revenue, Profit, Units Sold, Conversion Rate

Category Trends	Breakdown by category: sales volume, profitability, units
Manual Sales Entries	Table of user-added sales (for when Amazon data isn’t yet connected)
Goal Progress Summary	Shows progress toward active sales or profit goals

🔗 How It Connects to Other Sub-Pages
Connected Sub-Page	How It’s Connected
📦 Inventory	Sales are tied to SKUs from inventory. Performance calculates revenue/profit using price/cost from InventoryItem.
📊 Dashboard	Dashboard pulls performance KPIs from here in summarized form.
🎯 Goals	Goals use SalesEntry data to evaluate whether a revenue or units target is being met.
📋 Reports	Many reports pull historical data from performance: revenue over time, top products, trends.
📝 SalesEntryModal	Used to input sales manually. These power the charts and metrics here.

💡 Performance Page Use Cases
User Intent	Example
“How did my business do last month?”	Revenue, profit, and units sold for the last 30 days
“Which products are top sellers?”	Breakdown by product SKU with units and profit
“Are Electronics more profitable than Health products?”	Category revenue/profit comparison
“Did I meet my sales goal?”	Goal progress shown inline
“Need to enter last week’s sales”	Manual entry system with editing & notes

🧠 Analytics Structure (Behind the Scenes)
Performance is powered by:

The SalesEntry model → every sale is tracked with SKU, quantity, date, and price.

InventoryItem → for matching cost data to compute profit and margin.

Custom aggregations → used to build /api/performance/metrics, /categories, and /sales-entry.

Example revenue calc:

ts
Copiar código
revenue = sum(SalesEntry.unitsSold × InventoryItem.price)
profit = revenue - (unitsSold × InventoryItem.cost)
